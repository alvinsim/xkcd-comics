#+TITLE: XKCD Comics

XKCD Comics is a simple REACT application that queries the [[https://xkcd.com/json.html][XKCD API]] to get the metadata of a comic and displays it on the page.

This project is something I did for fun but mainly an excuse to do something (/from scratch/) with [[https://reactjs.org/][React]].

** About this application

This application allows you to browse through all of the XKCD comics.

On first load, it shows the latest comic. By using the navigation bar, you can view the previous or next comics, first and latest, and also have it randomly show a comic.

You can also favourite a comic, by clicking on the 'heart' icon next to the comic's title. This will save the comic's metadata to the =redux= store.

Clicking on the BLUE 'heart' button on the navigation bar will show you all your favourite comics. Because these data is not persisted to a database, all will be cleared when the application restarts.

This application uses
- =antd= for the UI.
- =less= for styling.
- =react-router-dom= for routing to the comic page and the favourite page.
- =redux= to persist a comic's metadata when the 'heart' icon is clicked.
- =redux-saga= for the redux middleware.
- =jest= for testing -- tests for the reducer and saga; and also snapshots..

** Getting started

If you want to play around with this project, clone this repository to your local machine.

*** Installing

Since this is a React web application, you'd need to have =node= installed. To run or install the necessary dependencies, you'd then need either =npm= or =yarn=.

Once that is sorted, you can proceed to install the dependencies using either =npm install= or =yarn install=, and start the application using =npm start= or =yarn start=.

** Issues

Because this application is calling an external API, your web browser will block the request. One option is to install a 'CORS' browser extension and add 'https://xkcd.com/' to the white list.

On Firefox, I use [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cross-domain-cors][Cross Domain - CORS]]; and [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc][Moesif Origin & CORS Changer]] on Chromium.
